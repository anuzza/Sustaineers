To set up the client of the website:

In the “main” branch of “https://github.com/macapedi/planeteers”, select the Code button and download a zip file of the code.
Upon unzipping, you will have a folder named “planeteers-main”.
You may move this folder into a better working directory outside of downloads folder like the documents or desktop folder. This step isn’t strictly necessary for the app to function but it is preferred.
Using the terminal, either standalone or inside of VS code, navigate inside the “planeteers-main” folder. Calling the “ls” command should show project files including ,but not limited to, package.json, Readme.md, and “src”.
Once the location is verified, run “npm install” to install necessary node modules for the project.
The client-side of the website may be launched with calling in the terminal “npm start”.
